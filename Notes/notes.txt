Minion Pro?

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_ligatures for greek ligatures
maybe used in the greek marginal notes. This may help explain why some
of the greek doesn't look quite right.

See Psalme 22,23 for exception to verse/drop cap handling of psalmes. We
need to handle this in a better manner. Check other psalmes.

I am ignoring n/u and r/t typos. they look to much alike.

Distinguish between Emph for emphasis and quotation.
When a quotation is split up with such as '(saith he)' make a seperate
UnEmph command?
When multiple quote are strung together, split them into multiple Emph's?
Speech, quote from Bible, quote from other works.

Make sure quotes start with a capital letter, and are preceeded by a ':',
e.g. He said: Let it be.

What about use of initial capitals and chapters that
begin with "VV"? See Genesis 22 for example.

In John/argument, see use of:
\footnote[j-arg-foot]{...}
and
\note[j-arg-foot]

Fix LNotes. See Comments in files marked with !!!
See extreme example in Matthew-25.
In particular, both the text AND the verse numbers in the first
argument need to be hard-coded. 
This example also means that the marks in the text wil not always
correspond one-to-one to a note, but rather several marks (in several
verses) can correspond to one note.
Also, unless the first argument ends in punctuation (such as "?"),
a period should be added.

What about \Var where the first part is empty?

Make sure that the LNote at the very beginning of Matthew:7
gets properly placed. If not, fix it. If so, consider moving
MNotes. At least those at start of LNotes.

Consider checking use of \emph where there is a \V or \XNote.
Early on, I started and stopped the \emph multiple times, but
that is probably not ideal. Let the various other formatting
take care of which font is being used.

expand various abbreviations --- õ and others
Replace VV, vv with W, w; & with and,
But &c with etc. Also, be careful of & in Latin!

Check on how to keep correct spacing after italics.
(Apparently done by \emph{...} already?)
also \emph and punctuation.  \emph and numbers.

Need to set cross-ref for 1. Tim. 6 ref to page in Preface, from
p. 2282.

in citations --- french spacing?  Regularize --- puctuation, use of
italics?
How do I handle periods at the end of a cite?  What about:
(... \Cite{De vtilitate cred.\ cap.~7.}) where the period is inside
parentheses?

seperate uses of \emph into logical groups --- quotation, important,
etc.??

Figure out a proper scheme to categorize notes: short, long, margin,
may be good enough, but some type of more thematic categorization
would be good. Also, make sure whatever scheme is used is actually
followed. Currently this is probably not true.

There are several points where there are extended quotes marked in
the margins with quotation marks. How should we handle this?


See the MNote in verse 9 of Psalme 75. This note appears in the margin
of both, whereas other SNotes appear in between the verses. I keep
this marginal here (should I?)  becauſe the two surrounding regular
SNotes are one piece of commentary, and this would interrupt
that. Does this occur elsewhere? I think a couple of the current
SNotes in the psalmes were in the margins. Check this.  But this isn't
really an MNote in my current schema. How to handle it?
But see the Marginal not for verse 15 in Psalme 71.

Some of the Psalmes have 'regular' SNotes (marked with four dots in a
square) as well as 'other' SNotes (marked by a letter). Do we care
about this distinction?

For MNotes about 'The first part. ...' of some book. Where should they go?
At present I think they are all in the Summary. Check this?

SNote in MNote Hebrewes chapter 07

Possible double SNotes (either two in a row, or one marked twice).

Will \Emph work in XRef?
See:
{ſeuen firſt Chapters of \Emph{Leuiticus}.}
in the fourth age.

Maybe re-introduce colons followed by capital letters?
First kinda sentance: Second kinda sentance.
I mostly made sentances end in periods for much of this.

For names, check h vs. b, t vs. r, c vs. e, n vs. u, and such.
Use newadvent.com's latin?

For things like:
\XRef{2.~Par.~15.}
&.
\XRef{17.}}
should they be:
\XRef{2.~Par.~15.}
\XRef{&.~17.}}
instead?

Old Testament preface is too long for header.

but Genesis' short title gets used in chapters.

first age title gets picked up for the rest of Genesis.
