  age}, from Abrahams going forth of Chaldea, to the parting of Iſrael
  out of Ægypt. The ſpace of 430.~yeares.},
  marking={The Third Age}
  ]

One
\MNote{The ſame Church & Religion in this age as in the former.}
and the ſame Church and Religion begunne in the firſt age of the world,
and continued in the ſecond, became more and more conſpicuous in the
third. For in this age not only the ſame principal and particular
pointes of faith, were beleued and profeſſed, but alſo the number of
profeſsors encreaſed and partly by ſeperation of place and abode, and
ſpecially by diuerſitie of maners, outward rites, and conuerſation were
more diſtinct from infidels then before: as vve shal now shew by the
ſacred hiſtorie of that time. VVhich beginneth with Abrahams going forth
of his countrey of Chaldea, about 1024.~yeares from the beginning of the
vvorld, in the 75.~yeare of his age.

From
\MNote{Beleefe in one God.}
which time forward God often appeared to him, and after him to Iſaac and
Iacob, in the title of \H{\Sc{El Saddai}}, that is, \Emph{God Almightie:
Creator of al things, Lord, God, moſt high, Poſſeſſor of heauen and
earth.}
\XRef{(Gen.~14.)}
To Moyſes more familiarly
\XRef{(Exod.~3.)}
in his moſt proper name, \Sc{He which is}. in the name of \Emph{foure
letters}, which the Iewes count \Emph{ineffable}. And in diuers other
names, al shewing \Emph{One, Eternal, Omnipotent, infinite Maieſtie}, of
whom al other things depend, and haue their being, himſelfe independent
of any other thing.

This
\MNote{Three diuine perſons.}
one diuine nature, and indiuiſible ſubſtane is (aboue al reach of
reaſon) \Emph{three in Perſons}: repreſented to Abraham
\XRef{(Gen.~18.)}
by three Angels, in forme of men, vvhom, by ſpecial inſtinct of God,
he \Emph{adored as one}: and firſt ſpake vnto them as to
one: \Emph{Lord} if I haue found grace in \Emph{thy ſigth}, goe no
paſt \Emph{thy} ſeruant; and by and by as to manie: VVash \Emph{yee
your} feete. In like maner Moyſes ſometimes ſpeaketh plurally as of
manie; \Emph{There appeared to him three men, they ſaied}: VVhere is
Sara? ſometimes ſingularly; \Emph{He ſaid: I wil come.} So Lot
\XRef{(Gen.~19.)}
Spake to \Emph{two Angels} repreſenting \Emph{the Sonne of God},
and \Emph{the Holie Ghoſt}, one God with \Emph{the Father}, firſt as to
manie, \Emph{I beſech you my Lordes}, turne into the houſe
of \Emph{your} ſeruant; after as to one: I beſech \Emph{thee my Lord},
becauſe \Emph{thy} ſeruant hath found grace before \Emph{thee}. VVho
likewiſe anſwered as one only: \Emph{I haue heard} thy prayer. Againe
Moyſes sheweth diſtinction of Perſons in God, ſaying
\XRef{(v.~14.)}
\Emph{Our Lord rained from our Lord.} Iob alſo (who liued in this age)
and his frendes profeſſed and ſerued the ſame one God, auouching him to
be the only God and Lord, that \Emph{geueth and taketh away.}
%%% o-0198
\XRef{Chap.~1.~2.}
He \Emph{the maker} and peculiar \Emph{Keeper of men. He that taketh
away ſinne, and iniquitie.}
\XRef{(c.~7.)}
\Emph{He that doth great things, incomprehenſible, and merdulous,
%%% 0217
wherof there is not number.}
\XRef{(c.~9.)}
And that with termes appropriated to the three diuine Perſons.
\XRef{(c.~26.)}
\MNote{\Emph{Strength} (or \Emph{power}) the Fathrs, \Emph{vviſedome}
the Sonne, \Emph{Spirite} the Holie Ghoſt.}
\Emph{In his ſtrength ſodainly the ſeas are gathered togeather, and with
his wiſedom he ſtroke the proud man. His Spirite hath adorned the
heauens.} The ſame Myſterie of pluralitie of Perſons in one God is more
clere by the Hebrevv text
\XRef{Chap.~30. v.~11.}
and
\XRef{35. v.~10.}
where the ſame actions are aſcribed to God, as to one, and as to manie.

But
\MNote{Chriſt promiſed to Abraham.}
moſt euident are the promiſes, figures, and prophecies of Chriſt our
Redemer. For beſides preſent abundance of riches, promiſe of great
progenie, and that the ſame should poſseſſe the fruitful Land of Chanaan
(three ſpecial bleſsings of the old Teſtament) God promiſed Abraham a
farre greater thing
\XRef{(Gen.~12.)}
that in his ſeede \Sc{al nations and kindreds of the earth shovld be
blessed}. In confirmation whereof, God alſo changed his name \Emph{Abram
(high or noble father)} into \Emph{Abraham (Father of manie nations.)}
\XRef{Gen.~17.}
And ſo he was natural father of foure great Kingdomes, \Emp{Iſmaelites,
Madianites, Idumeans, and Iſraelites}:
\CNote{\XRef{Rom.~9.}}
but ſpiritual father of manie more, to wit, of al that beleue in Chriſt,
Iewes and Gentiles, from that time to the worlds end.
\MNote{To Iſaac.}
The ſame promiſes of poſseſsing Chanaan and \Emph{of Chriſt} vvere
renevved and confirmed to Iſaac.
\XRef{(Gen.~26.)}
\MNote{And to Iacob.}
In like ſorte to Iacob.
\XRef{(28.)}
for they pertained not to Iſmael, nor to the other ſonnes of Abraham,
nor to Eſau.
\MNote{Chriſt prefigured by Abraham.}
Moreouer Chriſt, our Redemer and deliuerer from ſinne, and captiuitie of
the diuel, was prefigured by Abraham, at laſt deliuering thoſe from
captiuitie, who otherwiſe endeuouring to shake of the yoke of
Cordorlahomor, fel further into ſubiection and bondage.
\XRef{(Gen.~14.)}
\MNote{By Melchiſedech.}
Alſo Melchiſedech, King and Prieſt, of vnknowen generation,
extraordinarie vocation, without predeceſsor, or ſucceſsor, prefigured
Chriſt King and Prieſt for euer, who not by ſucceſsors, but by Prieſts
his vicars, perpetually exerciſeth al Prieſtly functions.
\MNote{By Iſaac.}
Likewiſe \Emph{Iſaac} borne aboue the common courſe of nature
\XRef{(Gen.~21.)}
ſingularly beloued of his father, carying wood on his back for the
ſacrificing of himſelfe
\XRef{(22.)}
\MNote{Iacob.}
\Emph{Iacob} flying his brother Iſau
\XRef{(27.)}
hardly treated by Laban,
\XRef{(31.)}
yet alwayes inuincible againſt his adſeruaries.
\XRef{(32.)}
\MNote{Ioſeph.}
\Emph{Ioſeph} hated of his brethren, ſold and deliuered to Gentiles.
\XRef{37.}
By them alſo perſecuted,
\XRef{39.}
but afterwardes aduanced, and called \Emph{the Sauiour of the world},
\XRef{(41.)}
\MNote{Iob.}
Iuſt \Emph{Iob} vehemently afflicted;
\MNote{Moyſes}
\Emph{Moyſes} hidden for a while, then expoſed to danger, and thence
deliuered: afterwards manifeſting him ſelfe to his brethren, by them
reiected, bewrayed, and flying from Pharao
\XRef{(Exo.~2.)}
returning againe
\XRef{(Exod.~3.~4. &c.)}
and at laſt deliuering the Iſraelites from bondage of Ægypt.
\XRef{(Exo.~14.)}
\MNote{And manie other things.}
And manie other things, as the ramme ſacrificed in place of Iſaac
\XRef{(Gen.~22.)}
the ladder of Iacob
\XRef{(Gen.~28.)}
Ioſephs ſcepter
\XRef{(47.)}
Aarons rodde
\XRef{(Exo.~7.)}
Paſchal lambe
\XRef{(12.)}
prefigured Chriſt, borne of a Virgin; the onlie Sonne of God; ſometimes
hidden, other
%%% 0218
times conuerſant with men, hated, perſecuted, ſold, betraied; vvho
caried his ovvne croſſe, was ſacrificed, vanquiched al his enimies,
aduanced, and
%%% o-0199
acknowledged the true \Emph{Sauiour of the world}, redemer and deliuerer
of mankind, from ſeruitude, ſlauerie, thraldome, and bondage of ſinne,
death, and the diuel.
\MNote{Prophecie of Chriſt.}
Againe Abraham prophecied that of his ſeede Chriſt our Sauiour should be
borne, when he ſaided to his ſeruant
\XRef{(Gen.~24.)}
\Emph{Put thy hand vnder my thigh, that I may adiure thee by our Lord
God of heauen & earth}, that is, by Chriſt, who should come of his
loynes, as S.~Hierom
\Cite{(Tradit, Heb. in Gen.}
\L{et}
\Cite{explic. Phal.~44.)}
S.~Ambroſe
\Cite{(li.~1. c.~9. de Abraham)}
and S.~Auguſtin
\Cite{(q.~62. in Gen.}
\L{et}
\Cite{li.~16. c.~33. ciuit.)}
expound it. More euidently Iacob
\XRef{(Gen.~49.)}
\Emph{The ſcepter ſhal not be taken away from Iudas, and a duke of his
thigh, til he do come that is to be ſent, and the ſame ſhal be the
expectation of the Gentiles.} Iob as planely:
\CNote{Iob.~19.}
\Emph{I know that my redemer liueth.} Moyſes foreknowing that Chriſt the
true Redemer, and chiefe Lawgiuer should be ſent, praied God to haſten
his miſsion, ſaying: \Emph{I beſech thee Lord, ſend whom thou wilt
ſend.}
\XRef{(Exod.~4.)}

External
\MNote{Sacrifice.}
Sacrifice was frequent and ſomemne, as the ſoueraigne homage to God.
\MNote{Altares.}
And manie Altares erected by Abraham for that purpoſe.

offered by Iacob,

with dedication of the place called \Emph{Bethel: the houſe of God}:
\MNote{Vowes.}
which he alſo before hand promiſed by vow.
\XRef{(Gen.~28.)}
Diuers other Sacrifices offered by Iſaac, and Iacob
\XRef{(Gen.~26.}
\XRef{31.}
\XRef{33.}
\XRef{36.)}
By Iob and his frends
\XRef{(Iob.~1.}
\XRef{&~42.)}
by Moyſes, Aaron, and other ancients of Iſrael.
\XRef{(Exod.~12.)}
\MNote{Prieſthood.}
Al which conſequently shew Prieſthood, whoſe proper office is to offer
Sacrifice, though amongſt al the aboue named, onlie Melchiſedech was
called a Prieſt. And among the Gentiles we finde that Putiphar
\XRef{(Gen.~41.)}
and Iethro
\XRef{(Ex.~3.)}
whoſe daughters Ioſeph and Moyſes maried, were called Prieſts or as the
word \H{Cohenim} doth alſo ſignifie, \Emph{Princes}, for they were great
and eminent men in their countries.
\MNote{Priuilege of Prieſts.}
At leaſt thoſe that by ſpecial
priuilege were exempted from ſelling their landes to Pharao, and had not
withſtanding prouiſion of mantenance in time of dearth
\XRef{(Gen.~47.)}
were properly called Prieſts, for ſuch function as they had in ſeruing
their idols.
\MNote{VVhere is no ſacrifice no Prieſt is required.}
For where vvas true and right Sacrifice, there vvere alſo right Prieſts,
and vvhere
\Fix{Idololatrical}{Idolatrical}{obvious typo, fixed in other}
ſacrifice there were like Prieſts, and vvhere no external ſacrifice at
al (as among Proteſtants) there are no Prieſts, but miniſters only.

In
\MNote{Circumciſion.}
this age alſo (long before Moyſes) the Sacrament of Circumciſion vvas
giuen to Abraham, for diſtinction of Gods ſelected and peculiar people,
and for remedy of original ſinne, in the male ſexe of Abrahams ſeede,
and others of his communitie. In the other ſexe, and other generation,
former remedies of ſacrifice, or other profeſsion of faith were
auailable.
\MNote{Penance.}
For other ſinnes, not
%%% 0219
not only internal repentance was neceſsarie, which vvas euer principally
required
\CNote{Gen.~44.}
(& therfore Ioſeph dealt ſo ſeuerly vvith his brethren, til they had
hartie ſorow and contrition for their ſinnes) but alſo certaine external
purifications, as vvashing and changing garments, vvere ordained.
\XRef{(Gen.~35.)}
\MNote{Mariage.}
Mariage though not then a Sacrament, yet was religiouſly regarded, with
ſepcial care of faith and religion in the choiſe of perſons,
\XRef{(Gen.~24.}
\XRef{27.~v.~46.}
\XRef{c.~28. v.~1.)}
\MNote{Degrees of cõſanguinitie.}
and of

certaine degrees of conſanguinitie and affinitie. Adulterie was
punishable by death
\Cite{(Gen.~38.)}
and in no wiſe counted lawful, no not among the heathen.

\XRef{26.}
\XRef{29.}
\XRef{34.}
\XRef{39.)}
\MNote{Pluralitie of wiues lawful ſometimes, neuer of huſbands.}
Pluralitie of vviues in ſome perſons and caſes, lawful in the lavv of
nature
\XRef{(Gen.~16.}
\XRef{25.}
\XRef{29.}
as alſo afterwards in the lavv of Moyſes, not in the law of grace, nor
euer pluralitie of husbands.

Spiritual
\MNote{Bleſſings.}
bleſsing, a preeminence of greater perſons, ſo Melchiſedech bleſſed
Abraham
\XRef{(Gen.~14.)}
Iſaac bleſsed Iacob
\XRef{(c.~27.)}
and Iacob his ſonnes
\XRef{(c.~49.)}
and the ſonnes of Ioſeph, with impoſition of handes, and
\MNote{Signe of the Croſſe.}
framing the forme of a croſſe.
\XRef{(48.)}
\MNote{Ceremonies.}
Other Ceremonies of oyle and wine
\XRef{(Gen.~28.}
\XRef{35.)}
\Emph{ſprinkling the bloud} of the Paſchal lambe, eating the lambe
\Emph{ſtanding} with their loynes \Emph{gyrded}, \Emph{ſhooes} on their
feete, \Emph{ſtaues} in their handes, and with \Emph{ſpeede}.
\XRef{(Exo.~12.)}
\MNote{Muſical inſtruments.}
Muſical inſtruments in Diuine ſeruice.
\XRef{(Exod.~15.)}

Chriſtes
\MNote{Baptiſme prefigured.}
Baptiſme prefigured by Circumciſion,
\XRef{(Gen.~17.)}
for Chriſtians \Emph{are circũciſed} (ſaith S.~Paul) \Emph{in the
Circumciſion of Chriſt, buried wih him in Baptiſme.} Alſo by
the \Emph{cloude} which ſtood betwene the Ægyptians and
Iſraelites, \Emph{lightning the night} on the one ſide (tovvards Gods
people) \Emph{dark} on the other (tovvards their enemies) and by
the \Emph{redde ſea}, vvhich ſaued the children of Iſrael, and drovvned
the Ægyptians.
\XRef{(Exo.~14.)}
\CNote{1.~Cor.~10.}
\Emph{Al were baptiſed in the cloude, and in the ſea.}
\MNote{The B.~Sacrament.}
So the bread and vvine offered by Melchiſedech, the Paſchal lambe, and
vnleauened bread prefigured the B.~Sacrament, and Sacrifice of Chriſts
bodie and bloud, in formes of bread and wine. Iacob alſo prophecied of
this moſt excellent Myſterie.
\XRef{(Gen.~49.)}
\Emph{He ſhal waſh his ſtole in wine, and his cloke in the bloud of the
grape.}
\MNote{}
In like ſorte Melchiſedechs Prieſthood was a plaine figure
of \Emph{Chriſts Prieſthood}, who firſt by himſelf conſecrated and
offered his ovvne bodie and bloud, and ſtil doth the ſame by his Prieſts
handes of the new Teſtament.

Diuers
\MNote{Traditions}
other Rites were knovven and obſerued by \Emph{Tradition}.
\MNote{Tythes.}
So Abraham paied Tythes to his ſpiritual Superior,
\XRef{(Gen.~14.)}
\MNote{Forme of iuſtice.}
taught his children and familie \Emph{to keepe the way of our Lord}, and
doe iudgement and iuſtice.
\XRef{(Gen.~18. v.~19.)}
\MNote{Precepts.}
Iſaac and Iacob kept and taught the Ordinances, Preceptes and Ceremonies
of their anceſters, vvithout Lavves or or precepts vvritten.
\XRef{(Gen.~26.)}
\MNote{Raiſing ſeede to the brother.}
Iudas commanded his ſecond ſonne to take the widow of his brother
deceaſed without children.
\XRef{(Gen.~38.)}
\MNote{}
The children of Iſrael abſtained from eating the ſinev of the thigh, in
remembrance that the ſinew of Iacobs thigh was shrunke.
\XRef{(Gen.~32.)}

Freewil
\MNote{Freewil.}
in men proued, by that Ioſephs brethren in ſelling him \Emph{thought
euil}, not moued nor inclined therto by God, who had no part in their
euil thought, but turned it to good.
\XRef{(Gen.~50.)}
By Gods threatning Pharao.
\XRef{(Exo.~8.)}
\Emph{If thou wilt not diſmiſſe Iſrael}: VVhich were vniuſt if Pharao
could not doe otherwiſe. Lokewiſe by that Pharao often changed his mind,
ſometimes promiſing to diſmiſſe the Hebrewes, and againe refuſing to doe
it, which sheweth (ſaieth Theodoret) freewil of the mind: and by Gods
preuention of tentation, \Emph{leading the Iſraelites not the neereſt
way, but by the deſert, leſt perhaps it would repent them; and they
would returne into Ægypt.}
\XRef{(Exod.~13.)}
Mans conſent therfore is free notwithſtanding Gods wil, direction, and
commandement.
\MNote{Mans induſtry neceſſarie.}
And ſo his induſtry is required
%%% o-0201
in his dailie affaires, and then to relie on Gods prouidence, otherwiſe
only to expect Gods wil, operation, or protection, man himſelf
endeuoring nothing is to tempt God. Therfore Abraham
\XRef{(Gen.~12.)}
Iſaac
\XRef{(c.~26.)}
Iacob
\XRef{(ca.~32.)}
and the parents of Moyſes
\XRef{(Exo.~2.)}
being in feare and diſtreſse vſed al prudence to auoid imminent dangers,
albeit they had ſpecial reuelations of ſafetie and happie ſucceſse.
\MNote{God tempteth not to euil.}
Neither doth God euer tempt anie man to ſinne, but proueth his ſeruants
and maketh them knowen to the world for example of others, and their
owne merit.
\XRef{Gen.~22.}
\XRef{Iob.~1. 2.~&c.}

Onlie
\MNote{Faith and good workes together iuſtifie, and are meritorious, but
neither of them alone.}
faith doth not iuſtifie, nor workes without faith, but both together do
iuſtifie, and are meritorious: ſo Abraham \Emph{beleued God} becauſe he
is omnipotent and truth it ſelfe, \Emph{and it was reputed to him vnto
Iuſtice}
\XRef{(Gen.~15.)}
but this faith was not ſole, for it had hope, loue, obedience, and other
vertues adioyned, and ſo his beleuing was an act of iuſtice. In like
maner
\CNote{\XRef{Iac.~2.}}
\Emph{Abraham was iuſtified by workes, offering Iſaac his ſonne
vpon the Altar}
\XRef{(Gen.~22.)}
but this worke preſuppoſed faith,
\CNote{\XRef{Heb.~11.}}
\Emph{that God is able to raiſe euen from the dead}.
\CNote{\XRef{Heb.~13.}}
\Emph{So by workes faith is conſumate.} By \Emph{hoſpitalitie} Abraham
and Lot vnawares receiued Angels to harbour.
\XRef{(Gen.~18.}
\XRef{19.)}
\MNote{Perfection in this life.}
\Emph{Abraham} was perfect according to perfection of this life,
\XRef{(Gen.~17.)}
\MNote{Foure principal merites of Abraham.}
moſt highly commended for foure more notorious actes proceding of two
ſpecial vertues faith and obedience.
\MNote{1.~Prompt obedience.}
The firſt was his prompt obedience, in leauing his countrie and kindred,
going he knew not whither, nor how farre, ſimply and cherfully expecting
Gods direction, when to goe, and where to abide.
\XRef{(Gen.~12.)}
\MNote{2.~Faith without ſtaggering.}
The ſecond was his excellent faith preſently beleuing Gods promiſe
(which by al humane reaſon ſemed vnpoſsible) that he should haue
innumerable progenie.
\XRef{(Gen.~15.)}
\MNote{3.~Propagation of faith and religion.}
The third was, that he did not only moſt ſincerly and religiouſly ſerue
God, but alſo taught his poſteritie ſo to do, and God himſelfe
teſtifieth of him, ſaying: \Emph{I know that he wil command his
children, and his houſe after him, that they kepe the way of the Lord,
and do iudgement and iuſtice.}
\XRef{(Gen.~18.)}
\MNote{4.~Perfect obedience.}
The fourth was that moſt heroical act of obedience, admirable
%%% 0221
to al ages, being readie to kil, and ſacrifice his owne moſt dearly
beloued ſonne Iſaac. \Emph{For which God ſware himſelf}, that he would
manie waies bleſſe him, \Emph{becauſe} (ſaieth God) \Emph{thou haſt
obeyed my voice}.
\XRef{(Gen.~22.)}
\MNote{Other iuſt men.}
He prayed for Sodom, and had preuailed, if tenne iuſt perſons had benne
found in that citie.
\XRef{(Gen.~18.)}
And Lot was deliuered from thence for Abrahams ſake.
\XRef{(Gen.~19.)}
\MNote{Iſaac.}
Iſaac was alſo of moſt ſincere mind, deuout to God, exerciſed himſelf in
meditation or mental prayer
\XRef{(Gen.~24.)}
obtained by prayer his deſire of iſsue.
\XRef{(Gen.~25.)}
\MNote{Iacob.}
Likewiſe Iacob is deſcribed in the holie text \Emph{a plaine} (or
ſincere and innocent) \Emph{man},
\XRef{(Gen.~25. v.~27.)}
patient and conſtant in tribulations.
\XRef{(Gen.~29.)}
\XRef{(31.)}
\XRef{(32.)}
\XRef{(33.)}
He lawfully purchaſed Eſaus conſent of the firſtbirthright.
\XRef{(Gen.~25. v.~31.)}
\MNote{He ſpake truth in myſtical ſenſe.}
He neither lied, nor otherwiſe ſinned, when he anſwered his father that
he was \Emph{Eſau his firſt begotten ſonne}
\XRef{(Gen.~27.)}
but ſpake truth in myſtical ſenſe, agreable to Gods wil and ordinance,
who ſo tranſpoſed Iſaacs bleſsing from Eſau to Iacob. VVhich Iſaac at
length vnderſtanding, conformed him ſelf therto, and confirmed the ſame
\XRef{(v.~33.}
\XRef{&~ch.~28.)}
giuing Eſau ſuch contentment as he could of temporal bleſsings.
\MNote{Ioſeph.}
Ioſeph is

renowmed for al vertues, euen from his youth to his death.
\XRef{(Gen.~37.}

Iob was \Emph{ſimple and right, fearing God and departing from euil, a
iuſt and innocent man}, both before and in his tribulations, \Emph{not
ſinning with his lippes: neither ſpake he anie foliſh thing againſt God}
\XRef{(ch.~1.)}
yea more afflicted \Emph{retained innocencie}
\XRef{(ch.~2.)}
and finally God receiued his prayer for others, and reſtored al his
loſses duble.
\XRef{(ch.~42.)}
\MNote{Moyſes.}
Moyſes a moſr ſpecial ſelected Prophet,
\CNote{\XRef{Nu.~12.}}
\Emph{the meekeſt man on the earth}, of ſingular zeale ſeuerly punished
ſinne,

but withal moſt charitable prayed God to forgiue the people and conſerue
his Church.

God
\MNote{Electiion is of Gods mercie.}
of his mere mercie electeth al thoſe, whom he wil iuſtifie and ſaue,
offering al ſufficient grace, iuſtly leaueth ſome obſtinate ſinners in
ſtate of damnation.
\XRef{(Gen.~25.}
\XRef{Exo.~7.)}
\MNote{Predeſtination excludeth not ordinary meanes.}
His predeſtination, foreknowledge and promiſe, do not exclude but
include the meanes, wherby his wil is done in the iuſt.
\XRef{(Gen.~25.}
\XRef{37.}
\XRef{45.}
\XRef{50.)}
\MNote{Sinne is the cauſe of reprobation.}
Neither is Gods reprobation the cauſe of anie mans damnation, but mans
owne ſinne the proper cauſe, both of reprobation & damnation. 
\MNote{Pharao and other Ægyptians hardned their owne harts.}
For example, Pharao & his people \Emph{enuying}, vainly \Emph{fearing}
and for their religion \Emph{hating}, and perſecuting \Emph{the children
of Iſrael}, by opreſsing them with vnſupportable laboures, by commanding
ſecretly to kil their infants, and that not ſucceding, by a new decree
to drowne them
\XRef{(Exo.~1.)}
were mercifully after long conniuence, admonished by Gods legates in his
name quietly to permit his people to ſerue him; but they wilfully
contemned this gentle admonition, Pharao proudly and inſolently
anſwering: \Emph{Who is the Lord, that I ſhould heare his voice, and
diſmiſſe Iſrael? I know not the Lord, and Iſrael I wil not diſmiſſe.}
\XRef{(Exo.~5.)}
So
%%% 0222
they hardned their owne harts, and more greuouſly afflicted the
faithful.

\MNote{Thare and Nachor reduced from idolatrie.}

\MNote{Manie profeſſors of true Religion.}
Al which being renowned men had great troupes, or rather countries,

\Emph{made readie of the ſeruants borne in his houſe, three hundred and
eighteene wel appointed}, men of armes, al of the ſame religion; for

Yet was king Melchiſedech of more power and authority then he. And the
other here mentioned, except his elder brother Nachor, and his nephevv
Lot, vvere his ovvne direct progenitors, and by liklihood more
potent. Againe from \Emph{Abraham} the ſucceſsion held on right \Emph{to

Ammon, at leaſt
