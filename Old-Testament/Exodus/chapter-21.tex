iudgements which thou shalt propoſe to them. \V If thou bye an Hebrew

gratis. \V With what rayment he entred in, with the like let him go out:
if hauing a wife, his wife alſo shal goe out with him. \V But if his
lord geue him a wife, and she beare ſonnes & daughters: the woman and
her children shal be her lordes: but himſelfe shal goe out with his
rayment. \V And if the ſeruant ſay: I loue my lord and wife & children,
I wil not goe out free: \V his lord shal preſent him to

the goddes, and he shal be ſette to the dore and the poſtes, and he shal
bore his eare through with an awle: and he shal be his bondman for
euer. \V If any man ſel his daughter to be a ſeruant,
%%% o-0220
she shal not goe out, as bondwemen are wont to goe out. \V If she
miſlike the eyes of her maiſter to whom she was deliuered, he shal
diſmiſſe her: but he shal not haue authoritie to ſel her vnto a ſtrange
people, if he deſpiſe her. \V But if he deſpouſe her to his ſonne, he
shal doe to her after the maner of daughters. \V And if he take an other
wife for him, he shal prouide her a mariage, and rayment, and the price
of her chaſtitie he shal not denie. \V If he doe not theſe three
thinges, she shal goe out gratis without monie. \V He that ſtriketh a
man wilfully to kil him, dying let him die. \V But he that did not lye
in waite for him, but God deliuered him into his handes: I wil appoint
thee a place whereunto he ought to flee. \V If a man of ſette purpoſe
kil his neighbour, and by lying in waite for him: thou shalt plucke him
out from mine Altare, that he may die. \V He that ſtriketh his father or
mother, dying let him die. \V He that shal ſteale a man, and ſel him,
being conuicted of the treſpaſſe, dying let him die. \V He that curſeth
his father, or mother, dying let him die. \V If men fal at wordes, and
the one ſtrike his neighbour with a ſtone or with his fiſt, and he die
not, but lye in his bedde: \V if he riſe, and walke abrode vpon his
ſtafe, he that did ſtrike shal be quitte, yet ſo that he make
reſtitution for his worke, and for his expenſes vpon the phiſicians. \V
He that ſtriketh his man or mayde ſeruant with a rodde, and they die in
his handes, he shal be guiltie of the crime. \V But if the partie
remayne aliue a day or two, he shal not be ſubiect to punishment,
becauſe it is his money. \V If certaine fal at wordes, and one ſtrike a
woman with
%%% 0242
child, and she in deede aborte, but her ſelfe liue: he shal be ſubiect
to ſo much damage as the womans huſband shal require, and as arbiters
shal award. \V But if her death doe enſue thereupon, he shal render
life for life, \V eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foote for
foote, \V aduſtion for aduſtion, wound for wound, ſtripe for ſtripe. \V
If any man ſtrike the eye of his manſeruant or maidſeruant, and leaue
them but one eye, he shal make them free for the eye which he put
out. \V Alſo if he ſtrike out a tooth of his manſeruant or maydſeruant
he shal in like maner make them free. \V If an oxe with his horne ſtrike
a man or woman, and they die, he shal be ſtoned: and his flesh shal not
be eaten, the owner alſo of the oxe shal be quitte. \V But if the oxe
were wont to ſtrike from yeſterday and the day before, and they warned
his maiſter, neither did he shutte him vp, and he kil a man or a woman:
both the oxe shal be ſtoned, and they shal put to death his owner
alſo. \V And if they ſette a price vpon him, he shal geue for his life
whatſoeuer he is asked. \V Alſo if with his horne he ſtrike a ſonne, or a
daughter, he shal be ſubiect to the like ſentence. \V If he inuade a
bondman or bondwoman, he shal geue thirtie ſicles of ſiluer to their
maiſter, but the oxe shal be ſtoned. \V If a man open a ceſterne, and
digge one, and doe not couer it, an oxe or an aſſe fal into it, \V the
owner of the ceſterne shal pay the price of the beaſtes: and that which
died, shal be his owne. \V If one mans oxe gore an other mans oxe, and
he die: they shal ſel the oxe that
%%% o-0221
liueth, and shal diuide the price,
and the carcaſſe of that which died they shal parte betwen them. \V But
if he knew that his oxe was wont to ſtrike from yeſterday and the day
before, and his maiſter did not keepe him in: he shal render oxe for
oxe, and shal take the carcaſſe whole.
