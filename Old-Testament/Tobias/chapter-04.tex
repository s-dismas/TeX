\Summary{Tobias thincking he shal dye, geueth his ſonne godlie
  admonitions: 7.~eſpecially exhorteth him to geue almes diligently,
  13.~to flee al fornication, pride, and fraude. 21.~And telleth
  him of money lent to a freind.}

Therfore when Tobias thought his prayer to be heard that he might haue
died, he called to him Tobias his ſonne, \V and ſayd to him:
\SNote{As Moyſes to the people
\XRef{Deut.~33.}
and Dauid to Salomon.
\XRef{3.~Reg.~2.}
So Tobias gaue holie admonitions to his ſonne: in al fourtene.
\Emph{Noted in the margins.}}
Heare my ſonne the wordes of my mouth, & lay them as a foundation in thy
hart. \V When God ſhal take my ſoule,
\MNote{1.}
burie my bodie: and thou ſhalt doe
\MNote{2.}
honour to thy mother al the dayes of her life: \V for thou muſt be
mindful what perils, and how great ſhe ſuffered for thee in her
wombe. \V And when ſhe alſo ſhal haue accomplished the time of her life,
burie her beſide me. \V And al the dayes of thy life
\MNote{3.}
haue God in thy mind: and beware thou conſent not to ſinne at anie time,
and pretermitte the preceptes of our Lord God. \V
\MNote{4.}
Of thy ſubſtance
\SNote{The ſame doctrine of good workes, and reward, is taught
\XRef{Daniel.~4. v.~14.}}
geue almes, and turne not away thy face from anie poore perſon: for ſo
it shal come to paſſe that neither the face of our Lord shal be turned
from thee. \V As thou shalt be able, ſo be merciful. \V If thou haue
much, geue aboundantly: if thou haue litle, ſtudie to impert alſo a litle
willingly. \V For thou doſt treaſure vp to thy ſelf a good reward in the
day of neceſſitie, \V becauſe almes deliuereth from al ſinne, and from
death, & wil not ſuffer the ſoule to goe into darkeneſſe. \V Great
confidence before God moſt high shal almes be to al them that doe it. \V
\MNote{5.}
Take heed to thy ſelf my ſonne of al fornication, & beſide thy wife
neuer abide to know crime. \V
\MNote{6.}
Neuer permitte pryde to rule in thy word: for in it al perdition tooke
his beginning. \V
\MNote{7.}
Whoſoeuer hath wrought anie thing for thee, pay him his hyre immediatly,
and let not the hyre of thy hyred ſeruant remayne with thee at al. \V
\MNote{8.}
That
\SNote{A notable rule, agreable to the law of nature.}
which thou hateſt to be done to thee by an other, ſee thou doe it
not to an other at anie time. \V Eate thy bread with the hungrie &
needie, and of thy garmentes couer the naked. \V
\MNote{9.}
Set thy bread, and thy wine vpon
\SNote{VVorkes of mercie extẽd alſo to the dead.}
the burial of a iuſt man,

and
\MNote{10.}
doe not eate and drinke therof with ſinners.

\V
\MNote{11.}
Seeke counſel alwaies of a wiſeman. \V
\MNote{12.}
At al time bleſſe God: and deſire of him, that he direct thy waies, and
that al thy counſels remayne in him. \V
\MNote{13.}
I tel thee alſo my ſonne
\SNote{It perteyneth to good men amongſt other thinges, to geue notice
and to diſpoſe of their temporal goodes by their laſt wil.}
that I gaue tenne talentes of ſiluer, whiles thou waſt yet a child, to
Gabelus, in Rages a citie of the Medes, and I haue a bil of his hand
with me: \V and therfore enquire how thou maiſt come to him, and receiue
of him the foreſayd weight of ſiluer, and reſtore him the bil of his
hand. \V
\MNote{14.}
Feare not my ſonne: we leade in dede a poore life, but we shal haue many
good thinges if we feare God, and depart from al ſinne, and doe wel.
