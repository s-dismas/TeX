\Summary{The tenne commandements are repeted and explaned, 23.~with
  commemoration of their dread and feare, when they heard the voice from
  the clowde, and ſaw the mountaine burne.}

And Moyſes called al Iſrael, and ſaid to them: Heare Iſrael the
ceremonies & iudgements, which I ſpeake in your eares this day: lerne
them, and
\SNote{It is not ynough to beleue only, or to know the commandments, but
neceſſarie alſo to \Emph{fulfil them in vvorke}.}
fulfil them in worke. \V The Lord our God made a couenant with vs in
Horeb. \V Not with our fathers did he make the couenant, but with vs at
this preſent, and doe liue. \V Face to face did he ſpeake to vs in the
mount out of the middes of the fyre. \V I was arbiter and
\SNote{The title of mediator lawfully aſcribed to Gods lieutenant in
earth.}
mediatour betwixt our Lord and you at that time, to ſhew you his wordes,
for you feared the fire, and went not vp into the mount, and he ſaid: \V
I the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of Ægypt out of
the houſe of ſeruitude. \V Thou shalt no haue ſtrange goddes in my
ſight. \V
\LNote{Thou shalt not make.}{If
\MNote{Images of Idols forbid, but not of other things.}
our aduerſaries would quietly conſider the coherence of the holie text,
they might eaſely ſee, that this prohibition of making, and worſhipping
the ſimilitude of anie creature, perteyneth to the former
ſentence: \Emph{Thou shalt not haue ſtrange goddes}: more particularly
forbidding either to make Idoles, or to worſhip ſuch as others make; and
that with commination, becauſe our Lord is a ielous God, and wil not
ſuffer his honour to be geuen to anie creature. But other Images were
made in the old Teſtament, by Gods commandment, and likewiſe Images of
Chriſt and his Sainctes are lawful and profitable among Chriſtians, as
before is noted.
\XRef{Exod.~20.}}
Thou shalt not make to thee a thing grauen, nor the ſimilitude of any
thinges, that are in heauen aboue, and that are in the earth beneath,
and that abide in the waters vnder the earth. \V Thou ſhalt not adore
them, and thou ſhalt not ſerue them. For I am the Lord thy God, a
Iealouſe God, rendering the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children
vnto the third and fourth generation to them that hate me, \V and doing
mercie vpon manie thouſandes to them that loue me, and keepe my
preceptes. \V Thou ſhalt not vſurpe the name of the Lord thy God in
vaine: for he ſhal not be vnpuniſhed that taketh his name vpon a vaine
thing. \V Obſerue the day of the Sabbath, to ſanctifie it, as the Lord
thy God commanded thee. \V Six dayes ſhalt thou worke, and shalt doe al
thy workes. \V The ſeuenth is the day of the
%%% 0431
Sabbath, that is, the reſt of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not doe any
worke therin, thou, and thy ſonne and daughter, man ſeruant and woman
ſeruant, and oxe, and aſſe, and al thy cattel, and the ſtranger that is
within thy gates: that thy man ſeruant may reſt, and thy woman ſeruant,
euen as thy ſelfe. \V Remember that thou alſo dideſt ſerue in Ægypt, and
the Lord thy God brought thee out from thence in a ſtrong hand, and
ſtretched out arme. Therfore hath he commanded thee that thou ſhouldeſt
obſerue the Sabbath. \V Honour thy father and mother, as our Lord thy
God hath commanded thee, that thou mayſt liue a long time, and it may be
wel with thee in the Land, which the Lord thy God wil geue thee. \V Thou
shalt not murder. \V Neither shalt thou committe aduoutrie. \V And thou
shal not ſteale. \V Neither
%%% o-0387
shalt thou ſpeake againſt thy neighbour falſe teſtimonie. \V Thou shalt
not couet thy neighbours wife:
\SNote{Coueting an other mans wife, and couetting his goodes, differ as
much, as the exterior actes of adultry and of theft. And ſo theſe two
commandments are as diſtinct as the former two.}
Nor houſe, nor field, nor man ſeruant, nor woman ſeruant, nor oxe, nor
aſſe, and al things that are his. \V Theſe wordes ſpake our Lord to al
your multitude in the mount, out of the middes of the fire and the
cloude, and the darkenes, with aloude voice, adding nothing more: and he
wrote them in the two tables of ſtone, which he deliuered vnto me. \V
And you after ſaw the mount burne, came to me al the princes of the
tribes and the elders, and you ſaid: \V Behold the Lord our God hath
shewed vs his maieſtie and greatnes, for we haue heard his voice out of
the middes of the fire, and haue proued this day that God ſpeaking with
man, man hath liued. \V Why shal we die therfore, and this exceding
great fire deuoure vs? For if we heare the voice of the Lord our God any
more, we shal die. \V What is al flesh, that is should heare the voice
of the liuing God, who ſpeaketh out of the middes of the fire as we haue
heard, and may liue? \V Approcho thou rather: and heare al thinges that
the Lord our God shal ſay to thee: and thou shalt ſpeake to vs, and we
hearing wil doe them. \V Which when our Lord had heard, he ſaid to me: I
haue heard the voice of the wordes of this people, which they ſpake to
thee: they haue ſpoken al thinges wel. \V Who shal geue them to haue
ſuch a minde, that they would feare me, and keepe al my commandementes
at al time. that it may be wel with them and with their children for
euer?
%%% 0432
\V Goe and ſay to them: Returne into your tentes. \V But thou ſtand here
with me, and I wil ſpeake to thee al my commandementes, and ceremonies
and iudgementes: which thou shalt teach them, that they may doe them in
the Land, which I wil geue them in poſſeſſion. \V Keepe therfore and doe
the thinges which our Lord God hath commanded you: you shal not decline
neither to the right hand, not to the left: \V but the way that the Lord
our God hath commanded shal you walke, that you may liue, and it may be
wel with you, and your daies may be prolonged in the land of your
poſſeſſion.
