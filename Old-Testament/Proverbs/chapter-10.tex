In the lippes of the wiſe wiſdom is found: and a rod on his backe that

Wiſe men hide knowlege: but the mouth of the foole is next to

The ſubſtance of a rich man, is a citie of his ſtrength: the feare of

The worke of the iuſt vnto life: but the fruite of the impious vnto

The way of life, to him that keepeth diſcipline: but he that forſaketh

As a tempeſt paſſing the impious shal not be: but the iuſt as an
euerlaſting fundation.

As vinegre to the teeth, and ſmoke to the eies, ſo a ſluggard to them,
